# Site-wide Header Image
You can set the header image site-wide by adding the following code to your `_config.yml`
```
header: images/IMAGE-NAME.png
```

## Per Page Header Image
You can also specify a different header image for any giver page by adding it to the yaml frontmatter for that page:
```
header: /images/IMAGE-NAME.png
```

(If you notice, this page has a custom header image from the rest of the site)
