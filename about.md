This is the Queen from the [Lewis Chessmen](https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/statements/the_lewis_chessmen.aspx). Depending on your point of view, she is either bored of men's games or distraught at the state of the nation.

I am a firm believer in the _Oxford Comma_, and I despise [~~"~~unnecessary~~"~~ quotation marks](http://www.unnecessaryquotes.com/).
