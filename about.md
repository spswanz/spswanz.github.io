<img class='oval-img' src="/images/LewisChessQueen.jpg" alt="Lewis Chess Queen">


This is the Queen from the [Lewis Chessmen](https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/statements/the_lewis_chessmen.aspx).

She is often my online avatar. Depending on your point of view, she is either bored of men's games or distraught at the state of the nation.

I am a firm believer in the _Oxford Comma_, and I despise "unnecessary" quotation marks like the ones in this sentence.

This site is hosted on GitHub, and loosely based on the Jekyll Minima theme with a lot of CSS tweaks. I like playing around with the typography the most. Notice how large the font size is. That's for people like me whose eyes worsen year after year from too much staring at the computer screen.

At the moment, I'm using the following fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):

- Alegreya for the main text
- Montserrat for everything else

I'm writing in Github-flavored Markdown using the Atom editor. People can be picky about these sorts of things. I don't think I am one of those people.
