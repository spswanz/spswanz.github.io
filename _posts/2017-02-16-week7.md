# Week 7: Reviews of DH GIS Sites

<!-- They may be defunct, overly technical, totally confusing, or kind of awesome. Be prepared to highlight for everyone else the intriguing and questionable features of the sites you explored.
How does mapping/GIS figure into the project? Is it necessary?
What kind of data is being used? Where is it from? Is it accessible or reusable?
How much does the design of the site matter in taking it seriously?
How would you rate its usability? -->

## City Witness: Medieval Swansea

Website: http://www.medievalswansea.ac.uk/en/ (2014)
Uses OpenStreetMap tiles and Leaflet JS
Produced by academics for general public. Includes game and tours

Only plotted six sites on modern map.
Take a tour of each witness story
Provides routes of the stories with sightlines, but primitive visiualizations do not proivde sightlines.


This page much more interesting than actual maps: http://www.medievalswansea.ac.uk/en/mapping-medieval-swansea/

indicates mapping as process more important than mapping as result


## Virtual Jamestown : John Smith's Voyages
http://www.virtualjamestown.org/smith_voyages/jsmith_voyages.html
meh - but old
by Virginia Digital History

compare with http://www.johnsmith400.org/voyageroute2.htm
better mapping tech, but too small
http://www.johnsmith400.org/map/

would we call it digital scholarship? why not?

## https://pleiades.stoa.org/

crowdsourced and authoritative - are those mutually exclusive?
built for both humans and computers - good
hadrian's wall vs. via flaminia
