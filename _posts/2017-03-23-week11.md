# Week 11: Network Analysis

Ted Underwood blogs a great example of why literary historians ought to skip a major step in Latent Semantic Analysis, because the purpose of the literary historian is so very different from that of the computer scientist who designed the algorithm.

Weingart 'If humanists care more about the differences than the regularities, more about what makes an object unique rather than what makes it similar, that is the very information they are likely to lose by defining their objects as nodes'

am I less wowed by wiz-bangery because I am a humanist at heart? techies are more willing to play with beta versions - I'm only interested after it's been proven to work.

actual testing is optional but still write essay and do tutorial

centrality - tests for  
  - degree: how many edges (lines) connect to the node
  - betweenness: how many hops it takes to get from one to another (the node that you hope thru the most has betweenness)
  - stress: sort of like betweenness - what happens when it goes down
  - __ vector: weighted connections, thickness of the line  (google search)

notes from allison caine:
