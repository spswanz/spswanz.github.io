# Week 5: Digital Spatial History

People have been making maps from the beginning of time and historians have always used maps to make sense of history. Maps are merely one form of information visualization. So there is nothing new about spatial history using maps in their research  

Maps are historical artifacts that can show what a specific culture or domain thought was important about their geography. Ship pilots used portolan maps that drew coastlines in great detail and added windrose lines to designate routes. These maps do not use any projection, never mind the ubiquitous Mercator projection.

, the Oregon Trail handbook showed how to get get from point A to point B, maps showed what the map designer did or did not know or imagined to be there - terra nullius, creatures real and imaginary inhabiting inner continents, hypothesized continents, etc. Medieval T-O maps placed Jerusalem at the center with the east at the top.

## Using Google Maps

I followed the Google Maps tutorial from the [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/googlemaps-googleearth). Now I know a lot more about UK imports of fat supplies in 1896. Google automatically converted place names into latitude and longitude coordinates and plotted the places and commodities on the map:

I did not love the results because I had to do more massaging than I expected. The colors for Whale Oil and Castor Oil were the same shade of yellow and I had to manually select another color to differentiate them on the map. You will also note that there are two separate entries for Train/Whale Oil, one with 7 records and one with 1. I checked the data set to make sure they were uniform and they were, so it is not clear why Google thought otherwise. When I used the same data set in Tableau as way to cross-check, it properly extracted eight records without error.
