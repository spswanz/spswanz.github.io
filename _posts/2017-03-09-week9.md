# Week 9: Text Mining

## Using Voyant

I decided to use a corpus I knew something about from an earlier project - the oral histories of the 1967 riots in Detroit collected by the Detroit Historical Society. You can learn more about the Detroit 67 Project [here](http://www.detroit1967.org).

As an aside, I was rather pleased with myself for using Beautiful Soup to write a Python script to extract the transcripts from the webpages into individual text files to use in Voyant. I was pleasantly surprised I got it to work as intended.

According to Voyant, `This corpus has 206 documents with 943,428 total words and 18,651 unique word forms.`

I did not get much out of Voyant on the macro level, but I separately loaded the individual text file for the interview of [Donald Lobsinger](http://detroit1967.detroithistorical.org/items/show/287) to see what I could get on the micro level. I chose this one because it was one of the longer interviews in my corpus so would have enough words to work with. Here's the word cloud that Voyant produced:

I knew that Lobsinger was a high-profile anti-communist agitator at the time, and this is born out in the word cloud with prominent words like *communist*. You can also see individual references to *martin*, *luther*, and *king*, and it would make more sense to consider those a single word than three separate words. The reference to Berlin is peculiar in this context of an oral history about Detroit, and reinforces that much of the testimony referenced Communism.

The word cloud revealed some issues with stop word lists - I would need to add *ww* and *dl*, the initials of the interview participants to the stop word list so that the algorithm ignored them.
The most frequent words list `detroit (90); communist (67); people (60); city (50); ww (49)` indicated that I should probably add the words *Detroit*, *people*, and *city* too.

You can also see some interesting things in the document segments window. This shows the term frequency of the words *communist* and *black* during segments of the interview:

The end of the interview must have been interesting!
