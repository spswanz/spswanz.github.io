# Week 10: Topic Modeling

more for discovery than analysis

if you have to know something about the corpus to train the model, what good is it?
I'd rather have something that took a corpus of text that not only told me which files mention Mercury, but which files mention Mercury the planet, rather than mercury the element or Mercury the Roman god.
although Ted Underwood piece suggested in did just that with 'lead'

what is a stop word?
so much fine-tuning required, need to provide technical specs to evaluate output

David Blei: 'A model of texts, built with a particular theory in mind, cannot provide evidence for the theory.[5] (After all, the theory is built into the assumptions of the model.) ''

all seems rather circular

Using Mallet
instructions difficult
used DHS project - made text files of transcripts only
made mallet files
already know the general topics - if all one subject matter, how will it be skewed?
only topic 2 seems to work as a topic - grouping words like law, court, judge
topic 2: [2	2.5	mm detroit remember jj don yeah case city black lp law judge jy communist walter court wallace put bg ]
the others are too hodgepodge
topic 1: [ww city sitting today riot time neighborhood rv growing don lived moved tension didn remember yeah born bf black]
topic 19: [school black park lived high city white work living wayne working worked moved years year don class highland neighborhood]
the two-letter words are initials of the participants  - should add to stop list along with Detroit
saw 'don' in topic list but didn't recognize the name -- seems to be reference to "don't"  does Mallet not handle apostrophes well?

Using Voyant
This corpus has 206 documents with 943,428 total words and 18,651 unique word forms.
Lobsinger - word cloud - communist, war
