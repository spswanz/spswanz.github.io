### What's this about?


I started this site because our professor in HIST 698 (Introduction to Digital Humanities) (find him [here](http://fredgibbs.net/)) asked us to make a personal webpage. You can find my weekly essays under [698 Portfolio](https://spswanz.github.io/Assignments.html). I'm sure he'd like this to be suitable for an academic audience, marketing ourselves professionally, and so on. In that case, no tenure for me!

I've since updated the site to house some other projects I've done:

- [Data visualization of the Dow Jones Industrial Average](/DJDataViz/index.html)
- [Safety and conveniences scores for Airbnb neighborhoods](/airbnbNeighborhood/index.html)
- [Cheat for NYT's Spelling Bee puzzles](https://spswanz.github.io/spellingbee.html)
