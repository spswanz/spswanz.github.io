### Things to fix -

I'd like the index page not to have the 'layout: home' because that adds RSS feed I don't want. It adds link to posts, which I need for now until I can set that up as separate assignments tab, which I don't know how to do.

How to get I get posts to show up on the 698 assignments page instead?

Want nav bar / TOC in body of index page, rather than on top.

How do I change nav bar anyway? I have a nav.html in my includes folder but I don't know what it does.  (I did manage to change the footer.html in the includes folder).
