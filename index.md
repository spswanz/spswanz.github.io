### What's this about?


I started this site because our professor in HIST 698 (Introduction to Digital Humanities) (find him [here](http://fredgibbs.net/)) asked us to make a personal webpage. You can find my weekly essays and starter projects under [DH Portfolio](https://spswanz.github.io/Assignments.html). I'm sure he'd like this to be suitable for an academic audience, marketing ourselves professionally, and so on. In that case, no tenure for me!

I've since updated the site to house some other projects I've done. You can find them [here](https://spswanz.github.io/Projects.html).
