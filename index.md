### Things to fix -

Btw, I do not find the Jekyll documentation particularly useful. It expects too much pre-understanding that I don't have.

I'd like the index page not to have the 'layout: home' because that adds RSS feed I don't want, but hesitate to change.

How do I change the ordering of links on the nav bar anyway? I have a nav.html in my includes folder but it's empty. Well, I did try and copy from Fred's Github repo, but not successfully. (I did manage to change the footer.html in the includes folder so I know I'm using includes properly).

Yay! Figured out how to add posts to assignments tab instead.

Formatting of CV page is lousy. Pandoc converted to Markdown okay, but had a lot of layout formatting that is lost.
Can you mix and match themes? Eg, I found a resume builder theme, but only need that for one page.

What do I want on my home page anyway?
Btw, do you know why AKK left Midd?
