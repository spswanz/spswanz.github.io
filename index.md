### What's this about?

Our professor in HIST 698 (Introduction to Digital Humanities) (find him [here](http://fredgibbs.net/)) has asked us to make a personal webpage. You can find my weekly essays under [698 Portfolio](https://spswanz.github.io/Assignments.html). I'm sure he'd like this to be suitable for an academic audience, marketing ourselves professionally, and so on. In that case, no tenure for me!

This site is hosted on GitHub, loosely based on the Jekyll Minima theme with a lot of CSS tweaks. I like playing around with the typography the most. Notice how large the font size is. That's for people like me whose eyes worsen year after year from too much staring at the computer screen.

At the moment, I'm using the following fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):

- Alegreya for the main text
- Montserrat for everything else

I'm writing in Github-flavored Markdown using the Atom editor. I use a 2012 MacBook Air that I hope will last another year.
